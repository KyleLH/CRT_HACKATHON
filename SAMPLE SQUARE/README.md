Team Name: Sample Square


Description: A potential music software/plug-in that creates a synthesizer based on sample clusters taken from a 2-D space populated with thousands of potential samples. The location of each individual sample in the space is decided by parameter values determined by the Spotify musical analysis. The user chooses a location on the 2-D space, and the closest neighboring samples are utilized and, in theory, a new tone/sound is created by the recombination of the fundamental frequencies of the samples referenced.
