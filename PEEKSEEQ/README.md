Team Name: peekseeq


Description: Peekseeq is an online user-maintained sample database that allows musicians to ‘try before buy’ through a built in web audio step sequencer. Peekseeq allows users to make loops/sequences with their choice of samples and to download these arrangements as loops, midi or sample packs to later use in a native DAW/outboard equipment. Arrangements are associated via cookies, and can be saved and shared with friends.
