Description: What you have to do is do npm install in the directory so the bootstrap sliders will work. The idea is that a bunch of users can control the inflow of samples coming from the converse sample library and they will all be filtered to a central server, where a performer decides which should be actually played etc. You can filter by danciness, bpm, etc.
